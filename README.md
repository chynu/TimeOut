# TimeOut
[Visit here](http://my-timeout.appspot.com/).

TimeOut is a simple website for a good cause. The website was created by Celine Choo, Pete Destil, and Nigel Harvey to support depressed or otherwise unhappy invidiuals in times of loneliness and need. When visiting this website, users can anonymously receive kind messages from real people in the world. The process is double blind and thus users can feel safe about visiting this site.

In addition, users can write kind messages for others who are feeling depressed, anxious, embarrassed, or unconfident. Users have the option to log in via their Google account to keep track of the messages they have written so that they can see how many people have viewed their compliments and how much their compliments have been appreciated. Only the user can see their own compliments, and their identity remains anonymous to the readers of their messages.

TimeOut was made using Google AppEngine at the 2016 Google Computer Science Institute, and was published and presented at Google NYC on August 5, 2016.
